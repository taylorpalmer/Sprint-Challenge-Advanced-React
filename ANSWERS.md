- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class Components are widely used in businesses today. It may be older code that still works so they don't want to pay someone to refactor it.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting renders components to the DOM. Updating reflects any changes in state that we need. Un-mounting clears event listeners from the DOM.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

A custom hook can be re-used throughout an application after being written once. Keeps code DRY!

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing our apps gives us confidence in functionality, saving potentially large amounts of time debugging later.
